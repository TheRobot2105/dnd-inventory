# Roadmap

Living checklist for shipping the D&D 5e (2024) Inventory Manager. Steps are intentionally fine-grained — one checkbox per file / function / test — so progress is visible and nothing slips. **Mark items only when fully done.**

Source of truth for *what* and *why*: `MVP.md`, `OUTLINE.md`, `TECH_STACK.md`. This doc tracks *progress*, not specs — if a step here disagrees with those docs, the docs win. The **MVP** section mirrors `MVP.md` §11 (M0–M7); the **Release** section mirrors `OUTLINE.md` §10 (M1–M7) and folds in §11 (Open Questions) + §12 (Future / Stretch).

Status legend: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[-]` skipped/dropped (note why).

## MVP

Mirrors `MVP.md` §11 (M0–M7). Each milestone has a trailing **Notes** block for free-form progress logging — dates, decisions, blockers, follow-ups.

### M0 — Skeleton

### M1 — Character + auto-provisioned stashes

"Create your character" form provisions User + Party + memberships + Character + Inventory / Party Stash / Recovered Loot.

**Schemas (`packages/shared/schemas/`)**
- [ ] `user.schema.ts` — Zod schema + inferred type
- [ ] `party.schema.ts` — Zod schema + inferred type
- [ ] `partyMembership.schema.ts` — Zod schema with composite-key invariant test
- [ ] `character.schema.ts` — Zod schema (STR only; placeholder fields per MVP)
- [ ] `stash.schema.ts` — Zod schema with `scope` discriminated union
- [ ] `itemDefinition.schema.ts` — Zod schema (no DMG fields yet)
- [ ] `itemInstance.schema.ts` — Zod schema (hard-coded MVP placeholders)
- [ ] `currencyHolding.schema.ts` — Zod schema
- [ ] `transactionLog.schema.ts` — Zod discriminated union over `TxType`
- [ ] `appState.schema.ts` — root Zod schema composing all above
- [ ] `index.ts` — barrel export
- [ ] Round-trip test: parse → serialize → parse equals input

**Reducer actions**
- [ ] `create-character` action type + payload schema
- [ ] `create-character` reducer case provisions User (if absent), Party, 2 memberships, Character, Inventory stash, Party Stash, Recovered Loot stash, 3 CurrencyHoldings
- [ ] Invariant test: exactly one party, two memberships (dm + player), one character
- [ ] Invariant test: `Character.inventoryStashId` points at an `isCarried: true` stash
- [ ] Invariant test: `Party.recoveredLootStashId` points at the recovered-loot stash
- [ ] Invariant test: log entry appended with `type: "create-character"`

**UI**
- [ ] `CreateCharacterForm.tsx` — name, species, class, level, STR fields with Zod-validated form
- [ ] Submit dispatches `create-character` action
- [ ] Welcome screen routes to form, form routes to Character Sheet on success
- [ ] `CharacterSheet.tsx` — header (name/species/class/level/STR)
- [ ] Tab navigation: Inventory / Storage / Party Stash / Recovered Loot (empty bodies for now)
- [ ] `CharacterSheet.test.tsx` — renders header from store after `create-character`

#### M1 — Notes

### M2 — Catalog + Inventory adds

PHB seed loads; Catalog Browser; add items to a stash; auto-stack; quantity edits.

**Seed pipeline (`packages/seeds/`)**
- [ ] `phb-2024-mundane.json` placed (private, gitignored or note-only per `../CLAUDE.md`)
- [ ] `phb-2024-mundane.schema.ts` — Zod schema for the seed file
- [ ] `loader.ts` — `loadPhbSeed()` returns parsed, validated entries
- [ ] `loader.test.ts` — seed file parses against schema
- [ ] `seedVersion` exported as a constant

**Reducer**
- [ ] App boot seeds PHB catalog on first launch (empty `seedVersion` → full seed)
- [ ] First-launch seed test: boot with empty AppState → catalog populated, `seedVersion` set
- [ ] App boot upserts PHB entries when `seedVersion` is behind bundle (homebrew untouched)
- [ ] Boot-upsert test: stale seedVersion triggers upsert; homebrew rows survive
- [ ] `acquire` action type + payload schema (adds an `ItemInstance` to a stash)
- [ ] `acquire` reducer case implements auto-stack on `(definitionId, notes ?? "")`
- [ ] Auto-stack test: adding same `(defId, notes)` twice → one row, qty 2
- [ ] Auto-stack test: same defId with different notes → two rows
- [ ] `consume` action (quantity decrement / row removal at 0)
- [ ] `consume` test: decrement above 0 keeps row, decrement to 0 removes it
- [ ] Log entries appended for `acquire` and `consume`

**UI**
- [ ] `AddItemModal.tsx` with Catalog / Custom tabs (Custom is stubbed for M6)
- [ ] Catalog search input + category filter
- [ ] Catalog row with quantity selector + "Add to [current stash]"
- [ ] Inventory tab renders item rows from store
- [ ] Per-row quantity adjust (+/− buttons) dispatching `acquire` / `consume`
- [ ] Per-row Remove action with confirm
- [ ] `CatalogBrowser.tsx` route (read-only PHB list with placeholder Duplicate button for M6)
- [ ] Component test: add same item twice → one row, qty 2 in the DOM

**Item Detail screen (per `MVP.md` §7 screen 4)**
- [ ] `ItemDetail.tsx` — full description, quantity, notes (per-item history hidden, data captured)
- [ ] Click an item row in any stash navigates to its Item Detail
- [ ] `edit-item-instance` action + payload schema (notes, customName, quantity) — **NOTE: new TxType not yet in `OUTLINE.md` §4 — propose adding before implementing**
- [ ] Edit notes on item instance dispatches `edit-item-instance`
- [ ] Edit customName on item instance dispatches `edit-item-instance`
- [ ] Edit-instance test: changes persist; log entry recorded
- [ ] Invariant test: `edit-item-instance` rejects edits to fields not owned by the instance (rarity, weight, etc. live on the definition)
- [ ] Component test: edit notes → close → reopen detail → notes persisted

#### M2 — Notes

### M3 — Storage stashes

Create / rename / delete named Storage stashes; per-stash detail view.

**Reducer**
- [ ] `create-stash` action + payload schema (Storage only; Inventory/Party/Recovered are auto-provisioned)
- [ ] `create-stash` test: appends Stash + matching CurrencyHolding row
- [ ] Invariant test: cannot create a second `isCarried: true` stash for the same character
- [ ] `rename-stash` action + reducer case
- [ ] `rename-stash` test: name updates, id stable
- [ ] `delete-stash` action + reducer case
- [ ] `delete-stash` invariant: refuses to delete Inventory / Party Stash / Recovered Loot
- [ ] `delete-stash` behavior: items move to Recovered Loot, then stash + its CurrencyHolding are removed
- [ ] `delete-stash` test: items end up in Recovered Loot with provenance log entry

**UI**
- [ ] Storage tab lists Storage stashes as cards (item count + GP-equivalent placeholder until M4)
- [ ] "New Storage stash" button → modal with name input
- [ ] Click card navigates to `StorageDetail` route
- [ ] `StorageDetail.tsx` — items table, rename button, delete button (with confirm count)
- [ ] Component test: create → rename → delete flow

#### M3 — Notes

> -

### M4 — Currency

Per-stash coins, conversion helper, GP-equivalent totals on stash list/cards.

**Rules (`packages/rules/currency.ts`)**
- [ ] `toCopper(coins)` implemented
- [ ] `toCopper` tests cover all 5 denominations + zero + mixed
- [ ] `fromCopper(cp)` implemented (sensible denomination mix)

- [ ] `toGpEquivalent(coins)` implemented
- [ ] `toGpEquivalent` test
- [ ] `convert(coins, target)` implemented
- [ ] `convert` tests cover up-conversion (cp→gp) and down-conversion (gp→cp)
- [ ] `add(a, b)` / `subtract(a, b)` implemented with negative-guard
- [ ] `subtract` test: throws / returns error when result would be negative

**Reducer**
- [ ] `currency-change` action + payload schema (target stashId, delta object)
- [ ] `currency-change` reducer applies via `add` / `subtract`
- [ ] `currency-change` test: deltas applied, log entry recorded with before/after
- [ ] `currency-change` invariant test: refuses to push any denomination negative

**UI**
- [ ] Currency row component (5 coin inputs + total GP-equivalent)
- [ ] Inline +/− buttons per denomination
- [ ] "Convert" helper (source denom → target denom, qty)
- [ ] Storage cards / Party Stash summary show GP-equivalent total
- [ ] Component test: convert 100 sp → 10 gp updates row + total

#### M4 — Notes

### M5 — Move + Split

Move-all between any stashes; split action. Deleted-stash items flow through Recovered Loot.

**Rules (`packages/rules/inventory.ts`)**
- [ ] `addInstance(stashId, defId, qty, notes)` implemented (auto-stack)
- [ ] `addInstance` tests cover new row + stack-onto-existing
- [ ] `moveAll(itemInstanceId, toStashId)` implemented
- [ ] `moveAll` tests: same-stash no-op, cross-stash transfer, auto-stack on arrival
- [ ] `split(itemInstanceId, qty)` implemented
- [ ] `split` tests: valid split, qty >= original rejected, qty <= 0 rejected

**Reducer**
- [ ] `transfer` action + payload schema
- [ ] `transfer` reducer case wraps `moveAll`
- [ ] `transfer` test: source row decremented/removed; destination row appears or stacks
- [ ] `transfer` log entry includes from-stash, to-stash, defId, qty
- [ ] Split as a sub-mode of `transfer` (or its own action) — pick one, document in code
- [ ] Split test covered end-to-end through the reducer

**UI**
- [ ] `MoveItemModal.tsx` — target stash picker (all user-accessible stashes)
- [ ] `SplitModal.tsx` — quantity selector, in-place split
- [ ] Per-row Move / Split actions in every stash table
- [ ] Component test: move-all from Inventory → Party Stash updates both views
- [ ] Component test: split row in place; new row movable

#### M5 — Notes

### M6 — Custom items + duplicate

Homebrew create/edit/delete with live propagation; duplicate-to-edit for PHB.

**Reducer**
- [ ] `create-homebrew` action + payload schema
- [ ] `create-homebrew` reducer adds an `ItemDefinition` with `source: "homebrew"`
- [ ] `create-homebrew` test: catalog grows by 1; log entry recorded
- [ ] `edit-homebrew` action + reducer case (PHB rows rejected)
- [ ] `edit-homebrew` propagation test: changing name updates every stash row by `definitionId` lookup
- [ ] `delete-homebrew` action + reducer case
- [ ] `delete-homebrew` invariant: cannot delete a homebrew currently referenced by any ItemInstance (or: cascade-remove instances — pick one, document)
- [ ] Duplicate-to-edit: clones PHB row as homebrew with `duplicatedFromId` set
- [ ] Duplicate test: clone has new id, `source: "homebrew"`, original untouched

**UI**
- [ ] `HomebrewForm.tsx` — all `ItemDefinition` fields, Zod-validated
- [ ] AddItemModal "Custom" tab wired to `HomebrewForm`
- [ ] Catalog Browser: PHB row shows Duplicate; homebrew row shows Edit + Delete
- [ ] Edit flow opens `HomebrewForm` pre-filled
- [ ] Delete flow has confirm; surfaces "X stashes hold this item" count
- [ ] Component test: edit homebrew name → all stash rows reflect new name

#### M6 — Notes

> -

---

### M7 — Backup

Export JSON; import with replace-all confirm. Log entries captured for all mutations.

**Export / Import**
- [ ] `src/io/export.ts` — serializes full AppState (including log) to a JSON blob
- [ ] Export validates the AppState against root Zod schema before writing
- [ ] Export attaches `version`, `seedVersion`, and an ISO timestamp
- [ ] Export tests: round-trip (export → parse → re-validate) is identity
- [ ] `src/io/import.ts` — parses file, validates against root Zod schema
- [ ] Import rejects malformed input with a user-facing error
- [ ] Import test: malformed JSON → error; valid JSON → state replaced wholesale
- [ ] Settings UI: Export button → file download
- [ ] Settings UI: Import button → file picker + replace-all confirm dialog
- [ ] Settings UI shows current `version` and `seedVersion`

**Character & party rename (per `MVP.md` §7 screen 9)**
- [ ] `rename-character` action + payload schema — **NOTE: new TxType not yet in `OUTLINE.md` §4 — propose adding before implementing**
- [ ] `rename-character` reducer case + test (name updates, id stable, log entry recorded)
- [ ] `rename-party` action + payload schema — **NOTE: new TxType not yet in `OUTLINE.md` §4 — propose adding before implementing**
- [ ] `rename-party` reducer case + test
- [ ] Settings UI: Character name field with save
- [ ] Settings UI: Party name field with save

**Definition-of-Done for MVP** (per `MVP.md` §11)
- [ ] Fresh user can: create character, add mundane items, create ≥1 Storage stash, deposit to Party Stash, move items between all four stash types
- [ ] PHB seed populates on first launch (verified by manual smoke test)
- [ ] JSON round-trip end-to-end: export → wipe → import restores state **including log** (bit-for-bit identical, asserted by a test)
- [ ] Editing a homebrew item updates display in every stash holding it (smoke test)
- [ ] Adding the same item twice yields one row, qty 2 (covered by M2 tests, smoke-verified)

## Release (Post-MVP)

Sections mirror **`OUTLINE.md` §10** (M1–M7). Each release milestone adds **purely additive** changes — no MVP schema field renamed/removed. The fine-grained tasks reference the relevant OUTLINE.md subsections (§3.x features, §4 data model, §6 rules modules, §8 permissions). §11 (Open Questions) and §12 (Future / Stretch) are tracked as their own sections at the end.

### R4 — Multi-member parties (outline §10 M4)

Invite codes, multi-user joining, Party Stash, Recovered Loot, Banker appointment + distribution toolkit, DM/Player role split when 2+ members. Covers OUTLINE §3.1 (permissive-until-others-join), §3.2, §3.5 ("split evenly"), §3.10 (loot distribution), §3.14 (Banker), §8.1 (full permission matrix), §8.3 (leaving/kicking).

**Schema activations (§4)**
- [ ] `Party.bankerUserId` becomes settable (was always `null` in MVP)
- [ ] `Party.inviteCode` becomes user-visible / rotatable
- [ ] `PartyMembership` supports count > 2
- [ ] New parties default `isSoloShortcut: false`; legacy solo parties keep `true`
- [ ] Composite-key invariant test: `(userId, partyId, role)` allows DM+player for creator

**Reducer actions (§4 TransactionLog union)**
- [ ] `join-party` action + payload schema
- [ ] `leave-party` action: moves owned items + currency to Recovered Loot (§8.3)
- [ ] `leave-party` auto-clears `Party.bankerUserId` if departing player was Banker
- [ ] `leave-party` writes `revoke-banker` entry with `reason: "left-party"` when applicable
- [ ] `kick-player` action: same Recovered Loot transfer (§8.3)
- [ ] `kick-player` Banker auto-clear with `reason: "kicked"`
- [ ] `appoint-banker` action + payload schema
- [ ] `revoke-banker` action + payload schema
- [ ] Invariant test: DM cannot self-appoint as Banker (§3.14)
- [ ] Invariant test: Banker target must have active `role="player"` membership
- [ ] Invariant test: Banker role only legal when `memberCount >= 2`
- [ ] `dm-transfer` action + payload schema
- [ ] `delete-character` action + payload schema (`{ characterId, name, lastSessionId? }` per §4)
- [ ] `delete-character` reducer case: moves owned items + currency to Recovered Loot, clears `PartyMembership.characterId`
- [ ] `delete-character` invariant test: owning user keeps their membership (can recreate a character)
- [ ] `delete-character` log payload snapshots itemCount + currencyTotalCp (mirrors `delete-stash` pattern in §4)
- [ ] `currency-change` extended `reason` values (`split-evenly`, `gameplay-drain`)
- [ ] Action: split Party Stash currency evenly across characters
- [ ] Action: Banker gives currency / items to a specific player from Party Stash
- [ ] Action: Banker gives currency / items from Recovered Loot to a specific player
- [ ] Action: Banker takes from Party Stash / Recovered Loot into own purse
- [ ] Invariant test: when Banker active, DM cannot distribute to specific players (§8.1)
- [ ] Invariant test: when Banker active, players cannot self-claim from Party Stash / Recovered Loot (§3.14)
- [ ] Invariant test: when no Banker, players self-claim freely from both pools (§3.14)
- [ ] DM-only custom-item creation enforced once `memberCount >= 2` (§3.7, §8.1)
- [ ] `actorRole` on log derived correctly: `"banker"` if `Party.bankerUserId === actorUserId`, else membership role (§4)

**DM cross-character actions (§8.1 "Edit other players' inventory via explicit action")**
- [ ] DM-issued `acquire` / `consume` against another player's character (logged with `actorRole: "dm"`)
- [ ] DM-issued `transfer` between any two stashes in the party
- [ ] DM-issued `equip` / `unequip` on another player's character
- [ ] DM-issued `attune` / `unattune` (bypasses cap with explicit confirm; cap-override still logs)
- [ ] DM-issued `use-charge` / `recharge` on another player's item (force-recharge per §3.8)
- [ ] DM-issued character-field edits (name, species, class, level, STR) via explicit action — separate from owner self-edits
- [ ] Invariant test: every DM cross-character action writes a log entry that the affected owner can see in the party log
- [ ] Invariant test: no silent edits — UI never mutates another player's data without dispatching a logged action (§8 "DM principle")

**Server-side**
- [ ] Invite-code generation endpoint (DM-only, rotatable)
- [ ] Invite-code redemption endpoint
- [ ] Websocket join/leave channel per party (foundation for R5)
- [ ] Server authoritative checks for every action above
- [ ] Departure flow: archive empty parties (no destructive delete) per §8.3

**UI**
- [ ] Hub: Join party (paste code) flow wired
- [ ] Party Settings screen (§5.15): invite code regenerate / revoke, kick player, appoint / revoke Banker, transfer DM
- [ ] Member list with role badges (DM / Player / Banker)
- [ ] Party Stash (§5.5): Banker distribution controls (split-evenly, give-to-player, give-items-to-player)
- [ ] Party Stash for DM-when-Banker-active: distribute-to-player controls hidden; add/remove-for-gameplay visible
- [ ] Recovered Loot (§5.6): same Banker/DM split as Party Stash
- [ ] Offline banner activates for multi-member parties (§9)
- [ ] Component test: Banker toggle changes both Party Stash and Recovered Loot control sets

**DM Dashboard (§5.9)**
- [ ] `DmDashboard.tsx` route (DM-only; desktop-only per §5 form factor)
- [ ] At-a-glance grid: all characters with name + class + level + GP-equivalent
- [ ] Party Stash + Recovered Loot summary cards on the dashboard
- [ ] Total party gold (sum of all GP-equivalent across characters + pools)
- [ ] Click-through from any row navigates to that character's sheet (DM read-all)
- [ ] DM-only route guard (hidden from non-DM members)

### R5 — Live sync & history (outline §10 M5)

Websocket sync; per-item history; party log with session-tag filter; offline banner in party mode. Covers OUTLINE §3.11, §3.12, §4 `Session`, §5.8 (History/Log).

**Sync**
- [ ] Websocket party-room subscription (server pushes action diffs)
- [ ] Optimistic UI: web applies action locally, reconciles on server ack
- [ ] Conflict resolution policy documented and implemented (server is authoritative)
- [ ] Reconnect flow replays missed events
- [ ] Offline banner active in multi-member parties; writes blocked while offline (§9)

**Sessions (§4 `Session`)**
- [ ] `Session` entity (id, partyId, number, date, notes, isCurrent)
- [ ] Invariant: at most one `isCurrent` session per party
- [ ] Action: `start-session` (clears previous `isCurrent`)
- [ ] Action: `end-session`
- [ ] `TransactionLog.sessionId` populated from current session at write time

**History UI**
- [ ] Party log timeline view (§5.8)
- [ ] Filters: session / character / item / action type / actorRole
- [ ] Per-item history queried directly from log (no separate table, per §4)
- [ ] Permission rule: per-item history visible to current owner + DM (§3.11, §8)
- [ ] Virtualized list / pagination for long histories
- [ ] Banker actions tagged `actorRole: "banker"` visible to all members (§3.14)

### R6 — DM tools (outline §10 M6)

Loot distribution wizard (per-hoard mode), hoard generator, identification flow with hints, shop manager (static + modifiers). Covers OUTLINE §3.7 (search), §3.9, §3.10, §6 `hoard.ts` / `pricing.ts` / `search.ts`.

**Rules — activate stubs (§6)**
- [ ] `packages/rules/hoard.ts` implemented (DMG 2024 tables by CR/level band)
- [ ] `hoard.ts` tests cover representative CR bands
- [ ] `packages/rules/pricing.ts` implemented (base price × shop modifier; default 0.5× sell)
- [ ] `pricing.ts` tests cover modifier, override, and sell-to-merchant rate
- [ ] `packages/rules/search.ts` implemented (fuzzy across name + description + tags)
- [ ] `search.ts` tests cover ranking + filter combinations

**Schema activations (§4 `Shop`)**
- [ ] `Shop` entity activated (id, partyId, name, priceModifier, sellToMerchantRate, stock)
- [ ] `Shop.stock` entries: `{ itemDefinitionId, priceOverride?, quantity }` with `-1` = unlimited
- [ ] `ItemInstance.ownerType = "shop"` becomes legal
- [ ] Action: `purchase` (`{ itemInstanceId, quantity, currencyDelta, shopId }`)
- [ ] Action: `sale` (`{ itemInstanceId, quantity, currencyDelta, shopId }`)
- [ ] Purchase decrements finite shop stock; unlimited stock untouched

**Loot distribution (§3.10)**
- [ ] Loot Distribution Wizard screen (§5.10) — per-hoard choice: shared pool vs direct assign
- [ ] "Drop loot into shared pool" action (loot → Party Stash; players claim per §3.14 rules)
- [ ] "Assign loot directly to player" action (item lands in target character's Inventory or Storage)
- [ ] Wizard tags emitted log entries with the active session (§3.12)

**Hoard generator (§3.5, §5.11)**
- [ ] Hoard Generator screen using `hoard.ts`
- [ ] Output flows into the Loot Distribution Wizard

**Identification (§3.8, §5.13)**
- [ ] Identification Panel UI: list of unidentified instances in the party
- [ ] DM toggles `identified`; players see real name update via sync
- [ ] DM-set hint editable

**Shops (§3.9, §5.12)**
- [ ] Shop Manager screen: create / edit shops + stock + modifiers
- [ ] Manual purchase flow: DM resolves each buy/sell as explicit `purchase` / `sale` transfer
- [ ] Catalog Browser "Add to shop" picker

**Catalog search**
- [ ] Catalog search wired to `search.ts` (replaces M2's simple search)
- [ ] Filters by category, rarity, attunement-required, cost, source (§3.7)

### R7 — Polish (outline §10 M7)

Light/dark theme, responsive player views (mobile), fuzzy multi-field search, accessibility pass. Covers OUTLINE §5 form factor, §5.17 Settings.

- [ ] Theme system with light / dark / system-default toggle (§5.17)
- [ ] Player views mobile-responsive: Character Sheet, Party Stash, Recovered Loot, Transfer Modal, Item Detail (§5)
- [ ] DM tools remain desktop-only by design (§5) — verify layout doesn't claim otherwise
- [ ] Fuzzy multi-field search live across Catalog + stash tables (uses `search.ts` from R6)
- [ ] Accessibility: keyboard navigation across all interactive elements
- [ ] Accessibility: ARIA labels on all icon-only buttons
- [ ] Accessibility: color-contrast pass against WCAG AA
- [ ] Accessibility: screen-reader audit on Character Sheet + Party Stash flows
- [ ] Performance pass on log size (capping, IndexedDB pagination if needed)
- [ ] Re-seed conflict hints ("this item has updates" on duplicated PHB/DMG rows) (per `MVP.md` §12)
- [ ] Variant-rules toggle exposed in Settings (§5.17)
- [ ] **Bulk multi-select for move / delete** on stash tables (§3.4) — checkbox column, bulk action bar
- [ ] Bulk-move test: select N items, pick target stash, all transfer with one log entry each (or a single grouped entry — decide and document)
- [ ] Bulk-delete test: select N items, confirm once, all removed

### Open Questions (outline §11)

Track resolution before the relevant milestone ships. Each is a decision, not an implementation task — check once decided + linked in code.

- [ ] **Snapshot retention** — decide: hard-coded 30 days vs admin-settings-exposed (impacts R3)
- [ ] **Discord outage fallback** — decide: session validity window (N days) if OAuth unreachable (impacts R3)
- [ ] **Invite code lifetime** — decide: single-use vs reusable, time-bounded or not (impacts R4)
- [ ] **Recovered-loot pruning** — decide: grow forever vs auto-expire stale items (impacts R4/R5)
- [ ] **History detail level** — decide: ownership transitions only vs every edit on per-item history (impacts R5)
- [ ] **Default Storage stash on character creation** — decide: auto-create one vs zero (impacts MVP M1 / R1 polish)
- [ ] **DM-as-player on creation** — decide: explicit prompt vs auto-add deletable player membership (impacts R4)

### Future / Stretch (outline §12)

Not committed; capture interest + scope creep here so it doesn't leak into M1–M7.

- [ ] Live shopping session (promote shop module from static to live; players browse + buy in real time)
- [ ] Crafting tracker (downtime, components)
- [ ] Wear-and-tear / item conditions (homebrew-friendly)
- [ ] Item wishlist per character (DM hints)
- [ ] Print-friendly inventory sheet (PDF)
- [ ] VTT integration (Foundry / Roll20 character link)
- [ ] Public party directory (opt-in) for finding open campaigns
- [ ] Light character sheet expansion (AC, HP, proficiencies for fuller display)

## Cross-cutting / Standing Tasks

Not milestone-specific; revisit each release.

- [ ] `../CLAUDE.md` kept in sync with reality (rules, tech stack, invariants)
- [ ] OUTLINE.md / MVP.md kept authoritative — code never drifts ahead of docs without an update
- [ ] No `any`, `as any`, or `// @ts-ignore` introduced
- [ ] No localStorage usage (Dexie/IndexedDB only)
- [ ] No CSS-in-JS introduced (Tailwind only)
- [ ] `src/components/ui/` only modified via `shadcn-ui add`
- [ ] PHB/DMG seed files never committed to public history
